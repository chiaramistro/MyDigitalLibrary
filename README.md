## Home
The "Home" page is composed by two tabs where the user can view and manage their favorite books and authors. There are two dedicated tabs:
- **Books Tab**: user can see their favourite books. Each entry displays the title of the book.
- **Author Tab**: user can see their favourite books. Each entry displays the name of the author.

From this page users can add (using the plus "+" button on the top right corner) or remove their entries (from their details view) from their favorites list. 

## Search
The **"Search" tab** provides users with the ability to search for specific books or authors. Upon entering a title or a name in the search bar, a list of relevant results is displayed. Users can swipe left on an item in the list to add it to their favorites. This feature makes it easy to quickly add new favorites without navigating away from the search results.

## Details
The **"Details" page** allows users to view additional information about a selected book or author. This includes details such as:
- for the books, the book's cover and synopsis;
- for the authors, author's photo and biography. 
Users can access this page by tapping on a book or author from their favorites list.
From this page it is possible to remove an item from your favorites list by tapping on the heart icon on top right corner of the book or author you wish to remove.

## Functionalities
